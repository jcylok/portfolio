# portfolio

Technologies used: html, css, javascript, Jquery, Boostrap.
Your process/approach: 
- The website was divided into sections, where a nav bar is created to guide visitors to the sections. I used carousels to show my skills and the details in my portfolio. My personal accounts includng LinkedIn and Github are attached to the links in both the pop-up modal and the contact section.  
Unsolved problems: backend is not set up yet for saving data from form submission.
Your biggest wins and challenges:
- Biggest win: this is my first personal website
- Biggest challenge: how to make good use of boostrap.
Screenshots of the snippets of code you used to solve particularly interesting problems (think code highlights).
