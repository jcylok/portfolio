# portfolio

Technologies used:
- html, css, javascript, Jquery, Boostrap.

My process/approach: 
- The website was divided into sections, where a nav bar is created to guide visitors to the sections. I used carousels to show my skills and the details in my portfolio. My personal accounts includng LinkedIn and Github are attached to the links in both the pop-up modal and the contact section.  

Unsolved problems: backend is not set up yet for saving data from form submission.

My biggest wins and challenges:
- Biggest win: This is my first personal website
- Biggest challenge: How to make good use of the combination of boostrap. (need to override a lot fo default styling)
