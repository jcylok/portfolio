I'm a full stack developer with a Master degree in Applied Analytics from Columbia University. Having past experiences in the field of economics and customer service/advising counselor from previous careers shaped me into an effective team member. As a developer I always strive to improve my knowledge and learn new technologies to create useful and innovative applications. Discovering new technologies and acquiring new skills are my passion, I believe that it is always worth to learn something new. When I'm not coding, I enjoy working out, hiking, listening to music, and challenging myself to improve for personal growth.
